# BASE | Basic Math Contract Exercise

This project demonstrates the creation and deployment of a Basic Math Contract using Forge, based on the Coinbase Base tutorial.

## Goals
- Develop and deploy a Solidity smart contract on the Base Sepolia Testnet.
- Showcase basic Solidity functions and data types.
- Gain hands-on experience with Foundry and blockchain development.

## Features
- **Math Operations**: Includes functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with overflow and underflow checks.
- **Solidity Basics**: Demonstrates types, visibility modifiers, and error handling.
- **Deployment Tools**: Utilizes Foundry for development, testing, and deployment.

This project is based on the Coinbase Base tutorial. All rights to the original tutorial belong to Coinbase.
